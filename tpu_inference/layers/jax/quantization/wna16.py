"""Weight-only int4 (W4A16) linear and fused-MoE methods for the JAX path.

Serves compressed-tensors ``pack-quantized`` checkpoints with symmetric int4
weights (group or channel strategy) and unquantized activations, e.g.
``google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-w4a16-ct``.

The checkpoint ships three tensors per linear layer: ``weight_packed`` (int32,
``[out, ceil(in / 8)]``), ``weight_scale`` (``[out, in // group_size]``) and
``weight_shape`` (``[out, in]``). They are loaded onto the host, unpacked to
int4 ``[in, out]`` there, and only the int4 weight and its scale go to the
device, so HBM holds half a byte per weight.

At apply time grouped weights go through the gmm_v2 kernel, which dequantizes
each int4 tile in VMEM and multiplies it with the unquantized activation, so
the full-precision weight never exists in HBM. Groups at least as wide as the
MXU, channelwise included, use the XLA reference path instead, which is only
supported on layers whose input dim is not sharded.

Routed experts ship the same three tensors per expert and projection
(``experts.<i>.{gate,up,down}_proj``, e.g. a compressed-tensors export of Gemma
4 26B-A4B). They are unpacked on the host, fused into the GMM layout without
requantization, and served by the same gmm_v2 dequantize-before-matmul branch.

    The checkpoint holds ``experts.<i>.<proj>.weight_{packed,scale,shape}`` per

    goes through ``process_moe_weights`` and ``shard_moe_weights`` directly.
    ``process_quantized_moe_weights`` is deliberately not used: it requantizes

    per-channel ones.

    Only groups narrower than the MXU are served. gmm_v2 dequantizes those rhs
    tiles in VMEM and multiplies them with the unquantized activation; wider
    blocks, channelwise included, take its dequantize-after-matmul branch,
